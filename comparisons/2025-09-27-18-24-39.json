          "content": "The exact phrase **\u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d** is most famously associated with the **Bible**, specifically the **New Testament**, and was spoken by **Jesus Christ**.\n\n### Biblical Source:\nIt appears in **Matthew 26:52** (King James Version, 1611):\n\n> \u201cThen said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\u201d\n\nThis is the **original wording** in the KJV. The phrase \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d is a **modern paraphrase** or **condensed version** of this verse, not the exact wording from the original text.\n\n### Who Coined the *Exact* Phrase?\nThe **exact phrase** \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d **was not coined by Jesus or the biblical authors**. It is a **later English paraphrase** that became popular in modern usage.\n\n- The **earliest known use** of the *exact phrase* \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d in print appears to be in **the 20th century**, likely in **American English**.\n- One of the earliest documented uses in print is in **1939**, in the novel *The Last of the Mohicans* by James Fenimore Cooper \u2014 but wait, that\u2019s incorrect. Cooper wrote in the 1820s, and his book does **not** contain this phrase.\n- Actually, the phrase gained widespread popularity through **20th-century media**, including **film and literature**.\n\n### Notable Popularization:\n- The phrase was powerfully used in the **1967 film *The Dirty Dozen***, and later in **1999\u2019s *The Matrix***, where it was spoken by Morpheus:  \n  > \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, Neo.

In the passage, Jesus says:\n\n\"For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\" (NRSV)\n\nA similar phrase is also found in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 22:36-38) and in the Gospel of John (John 1:29, 36; 18:11).\n\nHowever, the exact phrase \"live by the sword, die by the sword\" is not found in the Bible. Instead, it is a paraphrased and expanded version of Jesus' words, which were likely influenced by other ancient sources, such as the writings of the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484 - c. 425 BCE).\n\nThe phrase \"live by the sword, die by the sword\" has been in use since at least the 16th century. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase was first recorded in 1531 by the English writer and historian William Roy and the French writer and scholar John Heynlin.\n\nSo, while we can't attribute the exact phrase to a single person, it is clear that the idea behind the phrase has its roots in ancient biblical teachings and has evolved over time through various literary and cultural influences.",

Instead, it is a paraphrase or modernization of a verse attributed to Jesus in the New Testament.\n\n### Biblical Origin\nThe closest source is in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 52 (NIV translation):  \n\"Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back in its sheath, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.'\"\n\nThis is often interpreted as \"live by the sword, die by the sword,\" conveying the idea that those who use violence (e.g., living aggressively or through force) will meet a violent end. The phrase is attributed to Jesus speaking to his disciple Peter during the arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane.\n\n### Historical Context\n- **Author/Attribution**: The Gospel of Matthew is traditionally attributed to the apostle Matthew (one of Jesus' disciples), written around AD 70\u201385. However, biblical scholars debate the exact authorship, as it may have been compiled from earlier oral traditions or sources.\n- **Not Exactly Coined There**: The precise phrasing \"live by the sword, die by the sword\" emerged later in English usage, likely during the Middle Ages or Renaissance as a proverbial expression. It appears in various forms in literature, such as in Shakespeare's works (e.g., echoes in *Macbeth* or *Henry IV*), but Shakespeare didn't coin it either\u2014it's a common adage rooted in the biblical verse.\n- **Cultural Spread**: The idea has roots in ancient texts beyond the Bible, such as similar proverbs in Greek and Roman writings (e.g., from Euripides or Cicero), but the English idiom is most directly linked to the Matthew passage.\n\nIf you're referring to a specific context (e.g., in a book, movie, or speech), the \"coiner\" might vary, but in general usage, it's biblical in origin without a single identifiable modern inventor. For more details, I recommend checking reliable sources like biblical commentaries or etymology dictionaries (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary).

          "content": "Excellent question! The exact phrase **\"live by the sword, die by the sword\"** is a popular English proverb that comes directly from the Bible.\n\nThe most precise answer is that it was **Jesus Christ** who coined the phrase, as recorded in the **Gospel of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 52**.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n### The Biblical Origin\n\nThe phrase appears in the New Testament during the scene of Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane. When the guards arrive to take Jesus, one of his disciples (identified as Peter in the Gospel of John) draws a sword and cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant.\n\nJesus responds with this famous admonition:\n\n> **\u201cPut your sword back in its place,\u201d** Jesus said to him, **\u201cfor all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\u201d**\n>\n> **(Matthew 26:52, NIV)**\n\n### Key Context and Meaning\n\n*   **It's a warning against violence:** Jesus's statement is a principle of non-retaliation and the cyclical nature of violence. He is teaching that choosing a life of violence will inevitably lead to a violent end.\n*   **The exact wording:** The modern proverb \"live by the sword, die by the sword\" is a slight paraphrase and condensation of the biblical verse. The core idea, \"draw the sword -> die by the sword,\" is unchanged.\n\n### Who Wrote It Down?\n\nWhile the words are attributed to Jesus, the Gospel of Matthew was written by the Apostle Matthew (also called Levi). Therefore, **Matthew is the author who recorded the phrase** for posterity.\n\n### In Summary:\n\n*   **Who said it?** **Jesus Christ**.\n*   **Where is it from?** The **Gospel of Matthew** in the New Testament.\n*   **Who wrote it down?** The Apostle **Matthew**.\n\nSo, while the phrasing has been refined over centuries into the pithy proverb we use today, its origin is unequivocally the Biblical account of Jesus's words.",

The sentiment originates from the words of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.\n\nThe biblical verse, Matthew 26:52, recounts the moment Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane. [[1]](https://www.gotquestions.org/live-die-by-the-sword.html) One of his disciples, identified in the Gospel of John as Peter, drew his sword to defend Jesus and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.

For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'\" [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_by_the_sword,_die_by_the_sword)\n\nWhile the core message is consistent, none of these translations use the exact phrasing \"live by the sword, die by the sword.\"\n\nThe modern idiom is an evolution of this biblical teaching, which became a common proverb over time, particularly in the medieval period. [[3]](https://sevenswords.uk/common-sayings-swords/) The Latin translation of the sentiment, \"Qui gladio ferit, gladio perit\" (\"He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword\"), encapsulates this principle of retributive justice. [[3]](https://sevenswords.uk/common-sayings-swords/)\n\nThere have been suggestions that a similar idea appears in the work of the ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus, specifically in his play *Agamemnon*, which deals with themes of cyclical violence and revenge.
