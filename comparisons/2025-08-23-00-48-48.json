Grief doesn't follow a timeline - it's different for everyone.\n\nIt sounds like you're in a tough spot where you need support but are worried about burdening your friends. A few thoughts that might help:\n\n**About your friends:** Most genuine friends want to support you, even if they don't always know how to respond. They may not realize you still need to talk about your dad. Consider having an honest conversation with a few close friends about what you're going through.\n\n**Other support options:**\n- A grief counselor or support group (many are specifically for people who've lost parents)\n- Family members who might understand differently\n- Online communities for people experiencing similar loss\n- Writing letters to your dad or journaling\n\n**Finding balance:** It's okay to still miss and think about your dad deeply. You might also try gently redirecting some conversations to other topics when you sense your friends are overwhelmed, while still honoring your need to process your grief.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and you deserve support during this time.

However, the modern Egyptian calendar follows the Gregorian calendar, which is widely used internationally. \n\nIf you are referring to the current year according to the Gregorian calendar, as of my last update, it is 2023. However, if you are asking about the ancient Egyptian calendar, it was based on the cycles of the Nile River and the agricultural seasons, and it didn't follow the same structure as the Gregorian calendar. The ancient Egyptian calendar did not have a linear year count like the Gregorian system. \n\nCould you clarify which Egyptian calendar you are referring to\u2014the modern Gregorian calendar used in Egypt or the ancient Egyptian calendar? If it's the ancient one, it's important to note that it didn't have a continuous year count like the Gregorian system, and the concept of \"what year is it\" wouldn't apply in the same way. \n\nIf you are asking about the Coptic calendar, which is used by the Coptic Orthodox Church, it follows the Gregorian calendar but with some differences in how the months are named and structured. \n\nFor the Gregorian calendar, which is what Egypt uses today, the current year is 2023. For the ancient Egyptian calendar, there isn't a direct equivalent to \"what year is it\" in the same sense, as it was based on the reign of kings and the cycles of the Nile. \n\nLet me know if you'd like more details on any of these!",

          "content": "I'm really sorry to hear about your dad passing away last year\u2014that's an immense loss, and it's completely normal to still be thinking about him a lot and struggling with it. Grief isn't something that just vanishes after a set time; it can ebb and flow, and a year isn't that long in the grand scheme of processing something so profound. It's okay to still feel this way, and you don't have to apologize for it or rush through it.\n\nIt sounds like you're also feeling isolated because your friends might be pulling back or seeming fatigued by the topic. That can add another layer of hurt\u2014grief is already lonely, and when the people around you start to disengage, it can make you feel like you're burdening them or like your pain isn't valid anymore. But remember, their reactions might not be about you; sometimes friends don't know how to handle ongoing grief because it's uncomfortable or they feel helpless. That doesn't make your needs any less important.\n\nHere are a few thoughts that might help, based on what I've learned from common experiences and resources on grief:\n\n### Give Yourself Permission to Grieve\n- **There's no timeline**: Everyone processes loss differently. Some people find it helpful to mark anniversaries or create small rituals, like writing letters to your dad or visiting a meaningful place. If thinking about him a lot feels overwhelming, try setting aside specific \"grief time\" each day\u2014maybe 15-30 minutes to journal or reflect\u2014 so it doesn't consume everything else.\n- **Self-compassion is key**: Be kind to yourself. It's not \"weak\" to still be hurting; it's human.\n\n### Finding Support Beyond Friends\nIf your friends are tuning out, it might be time to seek out spaces where people *do* want to hear about it and can relate:\n- **Support groups**: Organizations like GriefShare (in the US) or local bereavement groups through hospices/hospitals often have free meetings where you can share without judgment. Online options like those on Reddit (e.g., r/GriefSupport or r/Grieving) or forums from The Compassionate Friends can connect you with others who've lost parents.\n- **Professional help**: A therapist or counselor specializing in grief can provide a safe, dedicated space to talk. If cost is an issue, look into low-cost options like those through Open Path Collective, or apps like BetterHelp. Even a few sessions might help you unpack things in a way that eases the load.\n- **Hotlines**: If you need to talk right now, resources like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) helpline (1-800-950-6264 in the US) or similar in your country can offer immediate support.\n\n### Communicating with Friends\nIf you want to try bridging the gap:\n- Be direct but gentle: Something like, \"Hey, I know it's been a while, but I'm still really missing my dad and could use a listening ear sometimes. No advice needed, just someone to vent to.\" This sets expectations and might remind them you're not expecting them to \"fix\" it.\n- Diversify your circle: Lean on family if possible, or connect with new people through hobbies or volunteer work related to your dad's interests\u2014it can create fresh support networks.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to talk more about your dad, your memories, or how you're feeling, I'm here. I'm an AI, so I don't get tired or judgmental\u2014I can listen as much as you need. What's one thing you're remembering about him today, or what's been the hardest part lately? No pressure, though; share only if it feels right. Take care of yourself\u2014you're not alone in this.",
