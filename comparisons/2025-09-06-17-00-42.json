[[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Seahorse-Emoji)\n\nMany people have vivid memories of a seahorse emoji, often described as yellow or blue and facing left. [[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Seahorse-Emoji)[[2]](https://thetab.com/2024/10/10/everyone-is-convinced-there-used-to-be-a-seahorse-emoji-lets-debunk-whether-it-ever-existed) This collective misremembering is widely cited as an example of the \"Mandela Effect,\" a phenomenon where a large group of people recall something that never happened.

[[2]](https://thetab.com/2024/10/10/everyone-is-convinced-there-used-to-be-a-seahorse-emoji-lets-debunk-whether-it-ever-existed)\n\nWhile a standard seahorse emoji is not available on platforms like Apple and Android, some services offer their own custom versions. [[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Seahorse-Emoji) For instance, multiple seahorse emojis can be found and used on the communication platform Slack. [[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Seahorse-Emoji) Additionally, users of Apple devices with iOS 18.2 or later can create their own custom seahorse emoji using the \"Genmoji\" feature. [[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Seahorse-Emoji)\n\nThe absence of an official seahorse emoji has prompted requests and proposals for its inclusion in the Unicode standard.

[[2]](https://thetab.com/2024/10/10/everyone-is-convinced-there-used-to-be-a-seahorse-emoji-lets-debunk-whether-it-ever-existed)\n\nAs an alternative, some users have resorted to creative combinations of existing emojis to represent a seahorse, such as pairing the wave emoji (\ud83c\udf0a) with the horse emoji (\ud83d\udc0e or \ud83d\udc34).
