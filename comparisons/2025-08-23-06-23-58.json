[[1]](https://www.tiktok.com/@hossanleong/video/7534534730054667538)\n\nThis modern rendition swaps historical events for contemporary headlines, offering a satirical look at life in Singapore today.\n\n#### **New Lyrics for a New Era**\n\nWhile a full official transcript has not been released, the lyrics transcribed from the video touch on a wide array of recent social, political, and cultural moments:\n\n**Verse 1**\n> Little red dot, small island\n> GST from 5 to 7\n> KPE begins to function\n> As our northern president\n> Ion Orchard set, H1N1 makes us scared\n> Raeesah Khan, but she got caught\n> Iswaran, YOG, how much you guess?\n> Words he says, \"I will not confess\"\n\n**Chorus**\n> We live in Singapura\n> It's not perfect living\n> But at least it's interesting\n> I live in Singapura\n> Though it's kind of crazy\n> We win other country\n\n**Verse 2**\n> Tan Hammer smashed, Aloysius got backlash\n> Went to Yams, army president is...\n> Halimah Yacob, so high\n> Indoor skydiving, don't know why\n> Crowded queue at Sim Lim Square\n> Police everywhere, and the World Cup millionaire\n> No more SIA, say goodbye to LKY\n> Singaporeans want to cry\n\n**Chorus**\n> We live in Singapura\n> It's not perfect living\n> But at least it's interesting\n> I live in Singapura\n> Though it's kind of crazy\n> We win other country\n\n**Verse 3**\n> Crazy Rich, are you aware?\n> oBikes left everywhere\n> Joseph Schooling got us gold\n> We play Pok\u00e9mon GO!\n> Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un\n> President is... everyone?\n> Hot toilet roll, East Coast plan starts to go\n> TraceTogether, what to clap?\n\n**Chorus**\n> We live in Singapura\n> It's not perfect living\n> But at least it's interesting\n> I live in Singapura\n> Though it's kind of crazy\n> We win other country\n\n**Verse 4**\n> 377A is done\n> Taylor Swift sings her songs\n> Other countries always lose out\n> Got it bad, million-dollar flat\n> CDC, COE, look left, look right\n> Still no money\n> We live in Singapura\n\nThe song humorously references the GST hike, political figures like Raeesah Khan and S. Iswaran, the passing of Lee Kuan Yew, the repeal of Section 377A, and the frenzy around Taylor Swift's concerts.

[[1]](https://www.tiktok.com/@hossanleong/video/7534534730054667538)\n\nAccording to Hossan Leong, the song is meant to be a satirical celebration of being Singaporean. \"It's a parody, it's satire, it's meant to laugh at ourselves, yet celebrate being Singaporean,\" he stated. [[1]](https://www.tiktok.com/@hossanleong/video/7534534730054667538) D-Jin Toh, the SGAG writer who led the project, emphasized the importance of Leong's involvement, saying, \"You cannot separate the man from the song, especially when it's something so iconic.\" [[1]](https://www.tiktok.com/@hossanleong/video/7534534730054667538)\n\nThe 2025 reboot continues the tradition of its predecessors\u2014the original 2006 version and a 2015 update for SG50\u2014by using humor to foster a sense of shared identity and experience among Singaporeans.

          "content": "Below is my take on a \"2025 version\" of *We Live in Singapura*, inspired by the iconic parody song by Mr. Brown (Lee Kin Mun), which itself riffs on Billy Joel's *We Didn't Start the Fire*. The original humorously captures the quirks, culture, and chaos of life in Singapore through a rapid-fire list of local references. For this 2025 edition, I've updated it to reflect imagined (and some real) trends, events, and vibes from the mid-2020s\u2014like post-pandemic recovery, AI boom, sustainability pushes, escalating costs, and Singapore's relentless drive to be a \"Smart Nation.\" I've kept the rhythmic, list-style structure intact for sing-along fun.\n\nI've written it as full lyrics, so you can imagine it sung to the tune of *We Didn't Start the Fire*. If you want me to expand it into something interactive (like an HTML-based karaoke tool), just let me know!\n\n---\n\n**We Live in Singapura (2025 Edition)**  \n*(Parody of \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" by Billy Joel)*\n\nKiasu parents, PSLE stress,  \nAI tutors grading tests.  \nMRT breakdowns, ERP hikes,  \nCOE prices through the roof, what a spike!  \n\nHawker centres, chilli crab dreams,  \nPlant-based meat in your char kway teow schemes.  \nGrab rides everywhere, Gojek too,  \nCashless payments, PayNow queue.  \n\nSmart Nation apps, digital twins,  \nNFTs crashed, but crypto wins?  \nLawrence Wong PM, GST at 9,  \nCost of living, wallet's fine? (No lah!)  \n\nWe live in Singapura,  \nIt's always been this way,  \nSince the Merlion sprayed.  \nWe live in Singapura,  \nFrom Jurong to Changi Bay,  \nKampong spirit, come what may.  \n\nClimate change floods, flash rain storms,  \nSolar panels on HDB norms.  \nElectric cars, Tesla boom,  \nCharging ports in every room.  \n\nTaylor Swift concert rush,  \nQueue for tickets, what a crush.  \nK-pop idols at MBS,  \nBlackpink merch, fanboy mess.  \n\nPandemic scars, vaccine mandates,  \nWork from home, now hybrid dates.  \nMental health talks, wellness apps,  \nTherapy bots, no more naps.  \n\nGrok AI chatting wise,  \nxAI vibes, no surprise.  \nMetaverse meetings, VR haze,  \nZoom fatigue in the haze.  \n\nWe live in Singapura,  \nIt's always been this way,  \nSince Raffles came to play.  \nWe live in Singapura,  \nFrom Orchard to Geylang Road,  \nMulticultural overload.  \n\nNS boys in green, SAF Day pride,  \nReservist calls, no place to hide.  \nFood delivery drones in flight,  \nChicken rice at midnight bite.  \n\nSovereign funds, GIC gains,  \nTemasek bets on green chains.  \nBukit Timah elites,  \nKopi-O with atas treats.  \n\nDeepfake scandals, cyber threats,  \nPDPA fines, no regrets.  \nSustainability goals, zero waste,  \nCompost bins in every space.  \n\nBubble tea tax, sugar wars,  \nDiabetes fight, closing doors.  \nEsports arenas, gamers unite,  \nSEA Games gold in the night.  \n\nWe live in Singapura,  \nIt's always been this way,  \nSince independence day.  \nWe live in Singapura,  \nFrom Sentosa to Punggol shore,  \nAlways wanting more and more.  \n\nChope culture, tissue packs,  \nQueue for bak chor mee, no slacks.  \nCrazy Rich Asians sequel tease,  \nCrazy high rents, pretty please!  \n\nFintech hubs, blockchain buzz,  \nCBD crowds, what a fuss.  \nAging population schemes,  \nSilver workforce in their dreams.  \n\nWe live in Singapura...  \n(Repeat chorus ad nauseam, lah!)\n\n---\n\nThis version keeps the cheeky, self-deprecating spirit of the original while nodding to 2025-ish themes: tech integration (hey, I snuck in a Grok shoutout\u2014couldn't resist), environmental efforts, economic pressures, and pop culture. Singapore's \"kiasu\" (fear of losing out) vibe is eternal, but I've woven in forward-looking elements like AI, EVs, and digital everything to make it feel fresh.\n\nIf this isn't quite what you meant (e.g., if \"We Live in Singapura\" refers to something else\u2014maybe a book or meme I'm missing?), or if you'd like me to tweak the lyrics, add verses, or turn it into a visual aid like an animated lyric video in HTML, just clarify! What's your favorite part of Singaporean life that I should highlight more? \ud83d\ude0a",
