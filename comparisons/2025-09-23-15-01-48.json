I recall there's a famous video of a pigeon that appeared to salute during a military parade in Russia, possibly involving Putin.

It went viral.\n> \n> \n> ## Interpreting the Question  \n> - The user's query is, \"Has a pigeon ever saluted Putin?\" It feels like a humorous or meme-related question.\n\nYes, in a bizarre and widely shared moment, a pigeon appeared to \"salute\" during Russia's Victory Day military parade in Red Square on May 9, 2019. The bird, perched on the balcony of a building believed to be part of Vladimir Putin's official residence (the Senate House), bobbed its head repeatedly as tanks and other military vehicles passed below. The footage went viral on social media, with many interpreting it as a salute due to the timing and motion. While it's likely just coincidental pigeon behavior (head-bobbing is common in pigeons for balance or curiosity), the Kremlin even joked about it in official statements, calling it a \"loyal pigeon.\" You can find the video easily on platforms like YouTube or Twitter/X from that time.",

However, the original footage, reported by the Russian state-owned media agency Ruptly, shows the pigeon moving away slightly and then continuing on its path without any responsive gesture.

          "content": "That's a fascinating and unusual question. The direct answer is **no, there is no verified instance of a pigeon saluting Vladimir Putin or any other world leader in the way a human would.**\n\nHowever, the question likely stems from a few specific and famous incidents involving pigeons and Putin that have been widely shared online. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what probably inspired the question:\n\n### 1. The \"Saluting\" Pigeon Incident (2019)\n\nThis is the most likely source. During a public event in Crimea in 2019, a pigeon landed very close to Putin while he was speaking. The bird then raised one of its wings in a gesture that, from a certain angle, looked vaguely like a salute.\n\n*   **What actually happened:** This was almost certainly a coincidence. Birds frequently preen, stretch, and adjust their feathers. The \"salute\" was a normal avian behavior caught on camera at a politically charged moment.\n*   **Public Reaction:** The video went viral, with many people joking about a \"patriotic pigeon\" or a \"KGB-trained bird.\" It was treated as a humorous and surreal moment rather than a genuine event.\n\n### 2. The \"Defecting\" Pigeon Incident (2022)\n\nIn a more bizarre incident in 2022, a pigeon landed on Putin's shoulder during a meeting with defense officials. This was also captured on video.\n\n*   **What actually happened:** The bird simply landed on a nearby structure and then hopped onto his shoulder for a moment before flying away. It was likely attracted to the location or simply resting.\n*   **Public Reaction:** This event also sparked a lot of online jokes and speculation. Some Ukrainian media ironically reported it as a \"Russian pigeon defecting to Ukraine,\" playing on the theme of dissent.\n\n### Why the Idea is So Persistent\n\nThe concept of an animal \"saluting\" a leader taps into a few powerful ideas:\n\n*   **Anthropomorphism:** We naturally tend to attribute human characteristics and intentions to animals.\n*   **Political Symbolism:** In authoritarian or highly nationalistic states, propaganda often uses imagery of nature and animals showing loyalty to the leader to symbolize the nation's unified support. A pigeon \"saluting\" fits perfectly into this kind of narrative, even if it's entirely accidental.\n*   **Internet Humor and Memes:** These videos became memes. The absurdity of a common city bird interacting so boldly with a powerful figure is inherently funny and shareable.\n\n**In conclusion:** While there is video evidence of pigeons behaving in ways near Putin that can be *interpreted* as a salute, these are random acts of animal behavior. There is no evidence that pigeons have been trained or have spontaneously saluted any world leader. The idea is a product of coincidence, camera angles, and the human tendency to find patterns and meaning where there is none.",
