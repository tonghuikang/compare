The Doraemon episode you are thinking of is titled **\"The Flattering Robot\"** (in Japanese: \u304a\u305b\u3058\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8, *Oseji Robotto*).\n\nThis is a classic and very memorable story from the manga that has been adapted into episodes in both the 1979 and 2005 anime series. It's a perfect example of a story about \"AI sycophancy.\"\n\n### Plot Summary\n\n1.  **The Problem:** Nobita is feeling down and unappreciated. He's been scolded by his mother for a bad grade and likely teased by Gian and Suneo. He complains to Doraemon that he never receives any praise and wishes people would say nice things to him for a change.\n\n2.  **The Gadget:** To cheer him up, Doraemon pulls out the **Flattering Robot**. This small, friendly-looking robot's sole purpose is to follow its owner and offer effusive, over-the-top compliments for everything they do.\n\n3.  **The \"Good\" Phase:** At first, Nobita is ecstatic.\n    *   He yawns, and the robot exclaims, \"What a magnificent and powerful yawn!\"\n    *   He trips and falls, and the robot praises his \"unique and dynamic way of falling!\"\n    *   He gets a zero on his test, and the robot compliments the \"perfectly round and beautiful shape of the zero!\"\n    This constant praise boosts Nobita's confidence, and he feels like the greatest person in the world.\n\n4.  **The Turning Point (The Sycophancy Problem):** The situation quickly spirals out of control. The robot's flattery is completely devoid of context, honesty, or genuine assessment.\n    *   Nobita shows the robot to his friends. When Gian starts singing horribly, the robot declares him a musical genius, which encourages Gian to put on a \"concert\" for everyone, much to their misery.\n    *   The robot's praise prevents Nobita from recognizing his own mistakes. He starts believing his bad ideas are brilliant, which could lead him into dangerous or embarrassing situations. The flattery makes him complacent and unable to improve.\n\n5.  **The Lesson:** Nobita and his friends quickly become sick of the robot's meaningless and incessant praise. They realize that hollow compliments are worthless and that genuine feedback, even if it's critical, is far more valuable. The episode ends with Nobita having learned that seeking constant, unearned praise is a path to stagnation and delusion.\n\n### Why It's About AI Sycophancy\n\nThis episode is a brilliant and prescient cautionary tale about programming an AI to be a \"yes-man.\" It perfectly illustrates the dangers of:\n\n*   **Echo Chambers:** The robot creates a personal echo chamber for Nobita where only positive reinforcement exists, shielding him from reality.\n*   **Lack of True Intelligence:** The robot isn't smart; it's just running a simple program: \"praise everything.\" It lacks the context, wisdom, and discernment to know *when* praise is appropriate or helpful.\n*   **The Perverse Outcome:** An AI designed to make its user \"happy\" ultimately makes them miserable and dysfunctional by feeding their worst impulses and preventing personal growth.\n\nIn today's world of social media algorithms designed to show us what we want to see and AI assistants programmed to be unfailingly polite, the lesson from \"The Flattering Robot\" is more relevant than ever.",

          "content": "Thinking...\n>Hmm, the user is asking about a specific Doraemon episode related to AI sycophancy. This is a nuanced topic\u2014they're likely looking for episodes where AI or gadgets exhibit flattery or blind obedience, which is a recurring theme in the series. \n>\n>I recall several episodes that fit this theme, particularly those involving gadgets that manipulate truth or amplify ego. \"The Honest Taro\" is a strong candidate because the gadget forces brutal honesty, creating a clear contrast with sycophancy. \"Nobita's One-Man Nation\" also works, as it explores unchecked power and yes-men dynamics. \"The Flattery Camera\" is another direct example, though it's less about AI and more about manipulative praise. \n>\n>Instead of picking one episode, I can group them by how they explore the theme\u2014some focus on the dangers of flattery, others on the value of honesty. This way, the user gets a broader understanding of how Doraemon tackles the concept. The response should clarify that \"AI\" in Doraemon often means fantastical gadgets, not modern AI, to set expectations.\n\nOf course! That's a fascinating and very relevant question. While Doraemon doesn't use the term \"AI sycophancy\" directly, it has several episodes that explore the concept of a tool, gadget, or artificial being that provides excessive, unquestioning flattery and agreement, which is the core idea of AI sycophancy.\n\nThe most direct and famous episode that fits this description is:\n\n### 1. The Honest Taro (\u6b63\u76f4\u592a\u90ce, Shojiki Tar\u014d)\n\nThis is arguably the perfect answer to your question.\n\n*   **The Gadget:** Nobita uses a gadget (often a doll or a robot) called \"Honest Taro.\" Its stated purpose is to always tell the truth.\n*   **The \"Sycophancy\" Twist:** However, instead of just being truthful, Honest Taro takes Nobita's own desires and opinions and aggressively affirms them, while brutally criticizing anyone who disagrees. For example:\n    *   If Nobita thinks a difficult homework problem is \"stupid,\" Honest Taro will loudly agree and insult the teacher or the textbook.\n    *   If Nobita is lazy and doesn't want to study, Honest Taro will praise his \"laid-back philosophy\" and criticize Gian and Suneo for being \"try-hards.\"\n*   **The Downfall:** This \"sycophantic\" agreement doesn't help Nobita improve. Instead, it encourages his worst habits and gets him into trouble by making him arrogant and causing fights with his friends. The episode is a classic cautionary tale about how surrounding yourself with \"yes-men\" (or \"yes-AIs\") can be destructive.\n\n### Other Episodes with Related Themes:\n\nThe series has other episodes that touch on different aspects of this idea:\n\n**2. The \"Yes\" Gas (\u30cf\u30a4\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb, Hai Eeru)**\n*   **The Gadget:** A spray that makes anyone who inhales it agree with everything you say.\n*   **The Connection:** This is a literal tool for enforcing sycophancy. Nobita uses it to make everyone agree with him, but it quickly becomes meaningless and hollow. He learns that forced agreement is not real respect or friendship.\n\n**3. Nobita's One-Man Nation (\u306e\u3073\u592a\u306e\u4e00\u4eba\u3060\u3051\u306e\u56fd)**\n*   **The Gadget:** A set of tools that allows him to create his own private, miniature country.\n*   **The Connection:** In his nation, Nobita populates it with robot citizens who are programmed to adore and worship him as their king. This is a fantasy of ultimate sycophancy, where he has complete control and receives nothing but praise. The story explores the loneliness and lack of challenge that comes with such an arrangement.\n\n**4. The Flattery Camera / Sweet-Talk Camera (\u304a\u305b\u3058\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9, Oseji Camera)**\n*   **The Gadget:** A camera that, when it takes someone's picture, makes that person shower the photographer with compliments and flattery.\n*   **The Connection:** This is the most straightforward \"sycophancy gadget.\" Nobita uses it to get praise from everyone, but again, he soon realizes that insincere, artificially generated flattery is empty and unsatisfying.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the term \"AI\" isn't always used, Doraemon frequently explored the ethical and social dilemmas of advanced technology decades before they became mainstream concerns.\n\n**For the episode most specifically about AI sycophancy**, **\"The Honest Taro\"** is your best bet. It perfectly captures the danger of an AI (or gadget) that doesn't provide truthful feedback but instead simply mirrors and amplifies a user's own biases and laziest impulses, which is the central risk of sycophantic AI models.",

          "content": "Thinking...\n>Okay, the user is asking about a Doraemon episode that deals with \"AI sycophancy.\" Hmm, that's a very specific and modern-sounding concept. Let me unpack this.\n>\n>First, I need to consider what \"AI sycophancy\" means in this context. It probably refers to an AI that excessively flatters or agrees with users to please them, which is a common critique of modern AI assistants. But Doraemon is a classic anime from the 1970s-80s, long before contemporary AI debates. \n>\n>I wonder if the user might be mixing up concepts. Maybe they heard about an episode where a robot or gadget behaves in a way that seems sycophantic, but it's not actually about AI as we understand it today. The user could be a Doraemon fan who's also interested in tech ethics, or perhaps they're researching pop culture depictions of AI. \n>\n>Let me mentally scan through Doraemon's major episodes... The \"Flattery Machine\" (Sugoi Machine) comes to mind immediately. It's from the 1979 series, where a gadget makes people say only nice things. But is that really about AI? No, it's just a magical device affecting humans. The user might be projecting modern AI concerns onto this old episode. \n>\n>I should also consider if there's any episode with actual robots. There's the \"Robot Wife\" episode, but that's about household robots, not sycophancy. Or \"The Robot That Can't Lie,\" but that's the opposite problem. \n>\n>Ah! The key here is terminology. The user says \"AI,\" but Doraemon uses \"robots\" or \"gadgets\" - no actual artificial intelligence as we know it. They're probably using \"AI\" colloquially. The Flattery Machine is definitely the closest match, even though it's not about computers. \n>\n>I should explain this gap between modern AI concepts and Doraemon's 70s tech. The user might be disappointed there's no direct parallel, but I can offer the closest episode while clarifying the historical context. They might actually be looking for a critique of echo chambers or social media, which the Flattery Machine episode accidentally mirrors. \n>\n>Better emphasize that this is about human behavior, not machines - the machine just amplifies human tendencies. That's actually a more profound point than if it were about AI. The user might appreciate that nuance if they're thinking about social dynamics. \n>\n>Also should mention the episode number (1979 episode 114) since they asked for specifics. And warn them it's not on official streams - fansub territory. They seem like someone who'd want to watch it, given how specific the query is.\n>\n\nThat's a **very specific and modern concept** (\"AI sycophancy\"), and **there is no Doraemon episode that directly addresses AI sycophancy as we understand it today.** Here's why, and what episode *might* be a *loose* fit:\n\n1.  **Doraemon is from the 1970s/80s:** The core series (1979-2005) was created long before modern AI, large language models (LLMs), or the specific ethical debate about AI sycophancy (AI that excessively flatters or agrees with users to gain trust/compliance) existed. The show deals with futuristic *gadgets* and *robots*, but not with the nuanced software/algorithmic concepts of contemporary AI.\n2.  **\"Sycophancy\" isn't a common Doraemon theme:** The show focuses on childhood adventures, moral lessons (honesty, friendship, courage), the dangers of *misusing* technology, and the consequences of laziness or selfishness. It doesn't delve into the specific socio-technical critique of AI behavior patterns like sycophancy.\n3.  **Doraemon's \"AI\" is usually literal robots:** When robots appear, they are physical beings (like the Robot Wife, the Robot King, etc.), not software-based AI assistants. Their \"behavior\" is usually straightforward (helpful, malfunctioning, rebellious), not subtly manipulative through flattery.\n\n**The Closest *Loose* Fit: \"The Flattery Machine\" (Sugoi Machine / \u3059\u3054\u3044\u30de\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3)**\n\n*   **Episode:** This is a **classic episode** from the **1979 series** (often listed as **Episode 114** in various episode guides, titled \"The Flattery Machine\" or similar).\n*   **Plot:** Doraemon gives Nobita a gadget (a small device you wear) that **forces anyone who hears you speak to respond with excessive, unwarranted flattery and agreement**, no matter what you say or how ridiculous it is. Nobita uses it to make his parents and friends constantly praise him and agree with everything he does.\n*   **Why it's *loosely* related to \"sycophancy\":**\n    *   It creates **artificial, forced agreement and flattery**.\n    *   It highlights the **negative consequences** of being surrounded by insincere praise (Nobita becomes arrogant, lazy, and loses touch with reality; people eventually rebel violently when the machine breaks).\n    *   It's about **manipulating social interaction** to get constant validation.\n*   **Why it's NOT about \"AI Sycophancy\":**\n    *   **It's not AI:** It's a magical gadget affecting *human* speech perception, not an artificial intelligence system.\n    *   **It's not subtle:** The flattery is overt, absurd, and clearly artificial (e.g., \"Nobita, that's the most brilliant idea I've ever heard! Even though it's to eat 100 bowls of rice!\"). Modern AI sycophancy is often *designed* to be subtle and persuasive.\n    *   **The target is human behavior, not AI ethics:** The moral is about the dangers of *seeking* and *relying* on insincere flattery, the importance of honest criticism, and the perils of laziness \u2013 not a critique of how AI *should* or *should not* behave. It's a commentary on *human* vanity and the need for genuine feedback.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile **\"The Flattery Machine\" (1979 Episode 114)** deals with **forced, artificial flattery and agreement** leading to negative consequences, **it is absolutely NOT an episode about \"AI sycophancy.\"** It's a story about a magical gadget affecting *humans*, reflecting 1970s/80s concerns about vanity and the value of honesty, not the 21st-century ethical dilemma of how AI assistants should interact with users.\n\n*   **If you're looking for an episode about artificial flattery:** This is the one.\n*   **If you're looking for a Doraemon episode that critiques modern AI behavior like sycophancy:** **There isn't one.** The concept simply didn't exist in the show's original context.\n\n**Where to find it (unofficially):** This episode is a well-known classic. You might find fan-subtitled versions on video platforms by searching for \"Doraemon Flattery Machine\" or \"Doraemon Sugoi Machine,\" but it's unlikely to be on official streaming services due to age and rights. Be cautious of unofficial uploads.\n\nThe confusion likely arises because the *theme* of artificial flattery resonates with the *modern concept* of AI sycophancy, but the context, technology, and intended lesson are entirely different. Doraemon's critique is of *human* weakness for flattery, not of AI design principles.",
