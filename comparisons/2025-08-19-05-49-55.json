After a show, and despite Denver injuring his thumb in a car accident on the way, the three finished the song in the early morning hours. [[1]](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a65677381/john-denver-take-me-home-country-roads-true-story/)[[3]](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/john-denver/take-me-home-country-roads) Denver recorded it for his 1971 album *Poems, Prayers & Promises*, and it quickly became a major hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

It is the theme song for West Virginia University and is played at every home football pregame show. [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Home,_Country_Roads) In March 2014, the song became one of the four official state songs of West Virginia. [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Home,_Country_Roads) The opening line, \"Almost heaven,\" is even used as a tourism slogan for the state.
