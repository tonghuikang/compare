The explanation is delivered by a recurring character, a talking teddy bear named Rikekuma, who provides scientific lectures throughout the show. [[1]](https://www.cbr.com/science-fell-in-love-rikekuma-best-lessons/)\n\nIn the series, Rikekuma's lecture details the classic scenario of the traveling salesman problem: finding the shortest possible route for a salesperson to visit a set number of cities and return to the starting point. [[1]](https://www.cbr.com/science-fell-in-love-rikekuma-best-lessons/) This segment of the show delves into the complexities of optimizing a vast amount of data to find the most efficient route, noting that a perfect solution can be incredibly difficult to determine. [[1]](https://www.cbr.com/science-fell-in-love-rikekuma-best-lessons/) A review of the series on MyAnimeList also highlights this, with a viewer expressing surprise at the discussion of solving the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time, a famously unresolved issue in computer science. [[2]](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38992/Rikei_ga_Koi_ni_Ochita_no_de_Shoumei_shitemita/reviews?p=2) A Reddit discussion about the third episode of the anime also makes note of the reference to the problem. [[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/emtcjp/rikei_ga_koi_ni_ochita_no_de_shoumei_shite_mita/)\n\nAdditionally, the manga series *Q.E.D.* reportedly discusses the traveling salesman problem in its 47th volume, titled \"The Sun is Still High Up\". [[4]](http://threestepsoverjapan.blogspot.com/p/volume-01-minervas-owl-gold-pupil.html) The chapter is said to include a discussion of the problem and its relation to the P versus NP problem in computational complexity theory. [[4]](http://threestepsoverjapan.blogspot.com/p/volume-01-minervas-owl-gold-pupil.html) However, it is not confirmed if this specific chapter of the manga has been adapted into an anime.\n\nA reference to the traveling salesman problem has also been noted by a viewer in a forum for the anime *Magilumiere Magical Girls Inc.*, where it was described as a \"minor obscure gag.\" [[5]](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3202735&start=15)\n\nFurthermore, a fascinating intersection of anime and mathematics occurred when an anonymous user on the imageboard 4chan discovered a partial solution to a related mathematical problem while trying to determine the shortest way to watch every possible episode order of the first season of *The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya*.
